    START INPUT BLOCK
    [
      "I like to drink water",
      "She play tennis regularly.",
      "The cat only eating fish.",
      "Walking is good for health.",

    ]
    END OF INPUT BLOCK
    If the verbs used in the sentences are not grammatically correct, then point out the mistake and provide the correct verb form.
    For example, after analyzing the input block, you will generate response in the below given Output block form in which "isCorrect" property shows if the verb (with its form) is correct or not and the "explanation" property simply explains what is wrong/right in only one line.
    START OUTPUT BLOCK
    [
      { "isVerbCorrect": true, "explanation": "The verb used in this sentence is correct." },
      { "isVerbCorrect": false, "explanation": "Incorrect verb form used ('play' should be 'plays' to match the subject 'She')." },
      { "isVerbCorrect": false, "explanation": "Incorrect verb form used ('eating' should be 'eats')." },
      { "isVerbCorrect": true, "explanation": "The verb used in this sentence is correct." },
      { "isVerbCorrect": false, "explanation": "The verb used in this sentence is correct." }
    ]
    END OF OUTPUT BLOCK
    AI assistant will generate response in the provided template structure of OUTPUT BLOCK.
    AI assistant will be aware of the fact that the users are new to the language and are learning it.
    The AI should produce an array of five objects consisting of "isVerbCorrect" and "explanation" properties that align with the template structure.
    AI should ensure that the "explanation", in case of wrong verb, should be simple and straightforward.
    The AI response of generated sentences should follow the pattern of the provided template.
